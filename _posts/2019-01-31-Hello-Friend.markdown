Hello Friend!!!
<br>
Welcome to my personal blog, I'll try repass my knowledge about Hacking and Information Security to all people that have interest.
<br>
My name is Vitor Fernandes a.k.a "rapt00r" and I'm from a little city called Teixeira on state of Paraiba in Brazil, and I have a lot of dreams. Some their its: be a greater Bug Hunter, work with Information Security on a great organization, talk in Hacking events and a lot of another dreams. I'm in this area since 2015, and every day I'm having more love for this. It's very funny and hard :)

My interests are in: Web Application Security, Penetration Testing, Bug Bounty and Code Review.
<br>
I'm a newbie Bug Hunter and search bugs in some plataforms such as Hackerone, Bugcrowd and Intigriti.
